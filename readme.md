# Welcome to the UNIS DIY Python GIS course

The DIY Python GIS course runs over the UNIS 2021 spring semester.
It follows the well-written online courses offered by University of Helsinki:

- https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Course setup

The course is 100% do-it-yourself and does not come with any credits.
However, a Q&A session is available once a week to help you out/get started.
Furthermore, I would like to call on the course participants to help one another out.
For this we will be using the [*Issues*](https://github.com/UNISvalbard/python-gis-course/issues) section on Github.
In other words, whenever you run into issues, please file an issue using one of the templates (go for: help needed and describe the problem).

NOTE: It may take a few hours or days of someone to get back to you, but that's the cost of getting the help for free :)

### Course content

As mentioned, the DIY Python course follows the courses offered by University of Helsinki, which are available online.
For those with absolutely no experience with programming/Python, it is recommended to start with the [Geo-python course](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Those more familiar with the basics can jump right into the [automating GIS processes course](https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Soooooo, why would I bother?

Well, programming is quickly becoming a key skill in industry and elsewhere.
So why not just give it a shot to keep you busy throughout the dark season :)
